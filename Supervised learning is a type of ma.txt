Supervised learning: is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns to map input data to a desired output based on a labeled dataset. In other words, it involves training a model to make predictions or decisions by providing it with input-output pairs where the data is correct.

Example: handwritten digit recognition: given images of handwritten digits and their corresponding labels(0-9) a supervised learning algorithm can be   

Spam email: detect the email of spam

some key details about supervised learning :
labeled data: In supervised learning, you start with a labeled dataset, which consists of input data(features) and their corresponding correct output. These labels serve as the ground truth that algorithms use to learn and make predictions.
Typess: 2
Classification: This is used when the output variable is a category or class label. The goal is to classify data points into predefined classes or categories, 
Regression: where output is a value 

natural language

Feature engineering Example: a bag of words: convert the word data to matrix. 
TF-IDF- (term frequency-inverse document frequency
word embedding 
word length

Data Splitt
Hyperparameter tuning:  

Example: 1 Learning Rate: Gradient descent neutral network
2 number of trees
kernel type
K-value
Depth of tree


Scalability
The choice of algorithm and model can impact the scalability of supervised learning

Two types of supervised learning: 
1. Classification: nature of object and output


Simple linear regression: managerial decisions often are based on the relationship between two or more variables. 

equation: y=b0 +B1x +e
b0(intercept of y) b1
Simple linear relationships are : 3 positive negative and neutral 
positive: 
least square method: 
formula: min E(y1-y2)
